This new assignment consists of two technical products. 
You will submit the following deliverables:  
Deliverable 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.  
Deliverable 2: Scrape and analyse Mars weather data, which exists in a table.

Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News

Use automated browsing to visit the Mars news siteLinks to an external site.. Inspect the page to identify which elements to scrape.

Store each title-and-preview pair in a Python dictionary and, give each dictionary two keys: title and preview. 

Store all the dictionaries in a Python list & Print the list in your notebook.

Part 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data

Use automated browsing to visit the Mars Temperature Data SiteLinks to an external site.. Inspect the page to identify which elements to scrape. Note that the URL is https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html.

Assemble the scraped data into a Pandas DataFrame. The columns should have the same headings as the table on the website. Hereâ€™s an explanation of the column headings:

id: the identification number of a single transmission from the Curiosity rover
terrestrial_date: the date on Earth
sol: the number of elapsed sols (Martian days) since Curiosity landed on Mars
ls: the solar longitude
month: the Martian month
min_temp: the minimum temperature, in Celsius, of a single Martian day (sol)
pressure: The atmospheric pressure at Curiosity's location

Analyze your dataset by using Pandas functions to answer the following questions:

How many months exist on Mars?
How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?
What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)?
Find the average minimum daily temperature for all of the months.
Plot the results as a bar chart.
Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars? To answer this question:
Find the average daily atmospheric pressure of all the months.
Plot the results as a bar chart.
About how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year? To answer this question:
Consider how many days elapse on Earth in the time that Mars circles the Sun once.
Visually estimate the result by plotting the daily minimum temperature.
Export the DataFrame to a CSV file.
